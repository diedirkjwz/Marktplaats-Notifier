## Marktplaats Notifier

Very simplistic script that will notify you when a keyword of interest has been encountered
in a fresh listing.

This was not created with the purpose of being production ready. If you'd still like to use this, though, know that it uses the Gmail API. To get your Gmail API up and running, look here:

There's plenty to find on it online too, it isn't all that hard.  
  
Cheers.
